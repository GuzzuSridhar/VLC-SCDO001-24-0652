# Exercises using loops in Python:
# ---------------------------------------------

### 1. **Sum of Numbers**
# Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number `n` and then calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop.


### 2. **Factorial Calculation**
# Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.


### 3. **Fibonacci Sequence**
# Create a Python program that prints the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, where `n` is input by the user.


### 4. **Multiplication Table**
# Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number using a loop.


### 5. **Check Prime Number**
# Write a Python program that checks whether a number entered by the user is a prime number using a loop.


### 6. **Reverse a String**
# Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse using a loop.


### 7. **Count Vowels**
# Write a Python program that counts the number of vowels in a given string using a loop.


### 8. **Print a Pattern**
# Write a program that prints the following pattern using nested loops:

### 9. **Sum of Even Numbers**
# Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and `n` using a loop.


### 10. **Number of Digits**
# Write a Python program to count the number of digits in an integer entered by the user.


### 11. **Find the Largest Number**
# Write a Python program that takes `n` numbers as input and finds the largest number among them using a loop.


### 12. **Guess the Number**
# Create a number guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. Use a loop to keep asking the user until they guess correctly.


### 13. **Palindromic Number**
# Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is a palindrome (same when read forwards and backwards) using a loop.

### 14. **Sum of Digits**
# Write a Python program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer using a loop.


### 15. **Find the GCD**
