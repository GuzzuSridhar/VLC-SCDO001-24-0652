## Python Exercise Questions

### Exercise 1: Grade Calculator
* Write a Python program to calculate a student's grade based on their score.
* The grading scale is as follows:
  * 90-100: A
  * 80-89: B
  * 70-79: C
  * 60-69: D
  * Below 60: F
* Prompt the user to enter their score and print the corresponding grade.

### Exercise 2: Leap Year Checker
* Write a Python program to determine whether a given year is a leap year.
* A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.
* Prompt the user to enter a year and print whether it's a leap year or not. 

### Exercise 3: Vowel Checker
* Write a Python program to check whether a given character is a vowel or a consonant.
* Use a match-case statement to efficiently handle the vowel checking.
* Prompt the user to enter a character and print whether it's a vowel or a consonant.

### Exercise 4: Number Classification
* Write a Python program to classify a number as positive, negative, zero, or one/negative one.
* Use a match-case statement to handle different number classifications.
* Prompt the user to enter a number and print its classification.

### Exercise 5: Simple Calculator
* Write a Python program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* Use a match-case statement to handle different operators.
* Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator, and then perform the calculation.
* Handle the case of division by zero.

### Exercise 6: Password Strength Checker:
* Write a program that takes a password as input and checks the strength based on length:
* Less than 6 characters: Weak.
* Between 6 and 10 characters: Medium.
* More than 10 characters: Strong.

### Exercise 7: Traffic Light Simulation:
* Write a program that simulates a traffic light using a match expression. 
* Ask the user to enter a color (Red, Yellow, or Green) 
* print what they should do (e.g., "Stop", "Slow down", or "Go").

### Exercise 8: Season Finder:
* Create a program that takes a month (as an integer) from the user 
* use a match expression to print the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) based on the month.

### Exercise 9: Mix of if and match
* Write a program that asks the user to choose between a temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) using a match expression. 
* Then, based on the unit * chosen, use if statements to determine whether the temperature is cold, moderate, or hot:
* Celsius:
-----------
* Below 10°C: Cold
* 10°C to 25°C: Moderate
* Above 25°C: Hot

* Fahrenheit:
-----------
* Below 50°F: Cold
* 50°F to 77°F: Moderate
* Above 77°F: Hot

### Exercise 10: Age check
* write a program that accepts the users age 
* verify if he/she is eligible to vote (age above 18 is eligible for voting)
